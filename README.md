# Step 1: Install NodeJs

Node.js is a JavaScript runtime built on Chromeâ€™s V8 JavaScript engine. Node.js is used in this tutorial to set up the Express routes and AngularJS controllers.

# Step 2: Install MongoDB

MongoDB stores data in flexible, JSON-like documents. Fields in a database can vary from document to document and data structure can be changed over time. For our example application, we are adding book records to MongoDB that contain book name, isbn number, author, and number of pages.

# Step 3: Install Express and set up routes to the server

Express is a minimal and flexible Node.js web application framework that provides features for web and mobile applications. We will use Express in to pass book information to and from our MongoDB database.

We also will use Mongoose package which provides a straight-forward, schema-based solution to model your application data. We will use Mongoose to establish a schema for the database to store data of our book register
